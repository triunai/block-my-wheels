# WhatsApp Session Management & Smart Template System
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Product**: Intelligent WhatsApp Business API session management with progressive escalation for parking notifications

**Goal**: Deliver urgent parking notifications through WhatsApp while gracefully handling session expiration using smart templates, quick reply buttons, and intelligent escalation.

**Core Principle**: **Progressive Escalation** - Start smart, escalate urgently when needed.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Current Issues:
- ❌ **Session Expiry**: WhatsApp enforces 24-hour session windows
- ❌ **Poor UX**: Requiring users to reply "OK" is terrible design
- ❌ **Lost Notifications**: Critical parking alerts fail when sessions expire
- ❌ **No Fallback**: Single point of failure for urgent communications

### Business Impact:
- **Revenue Loss**: Failed notifications = frustrated users = churn
- **Emergency Risk**: Blocked emergency vehicles due to failed alerts
- **Poor Reputation**: Unreliable service damages brand trust

---

## 🏗️ Solution Architecture

### **1. Session Tracking Strategy**

**Decision: YES to Intelligent Session Tracking** ✅

**Why Session Tracking Makes Sense for Scale:**
- **🎯 Predictable Behavior**: Know exactly when sessions expire
- **⚡ Proactive Management**: Send keep-alive messages before expiration
- **📊 Better Analytics**: Track session health across user base
- **💰 Cost Optimization**: Avoid failed API calls and retries
- **🔮 Future-Proof**: Enables advanced features like scheduling

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Session Data Structure (stored in n8n memory/database)
{
  phoneNumber: "+60123456789",
  lastUserMessage: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  sessionStatus: "active|expired|unknown",
  lastNotificationSent: "2024-01-15T09:15:00Z",
  preferredResponseTime: "5min|immediate|flexible",
  escalationHistory: []
}
```

### **2. Smart Template Design Philosophy**

**Primary Universal Template (Session Reactivator):**
```
🚗 PARKING ALERT: Your vehicle {{plate}} needs attention.

Quick actions:
👍 Moving now
⏰ Need 5 minutes  
❓ More details
❌ Can't move

Reply to activate instant notifications.
```

**Escalation Templates (Rage-Specific Fallbacks):**
```
Rage 1-2: "📱 Friendly reminder about vehicle {{plate}}. Quick reply options below:"
Rage 3: "🚨 URGENT: Vehicle {{plate}} blocking traffic. Immediate action needed:"
Rage 4: "🔥 CRITICAL: {{plate}} causing major disruption. Move NOW:"
Rage 5: "💀 EMERGENCY: {{plate}} blocking emergency access. MOVE IMMEDIATELY:"
```

## 🎮 Detailed User Experience Flows

### **✅ Happy Path (Active Session)**
```
Scenario: User texted bot 2 hours ago

QR Scan (Rage 3) 
→ Session Check: ACTIVE 
→ Direct AI Message: 
   "Hey! Your BMW ABC-123 is blocking someone with MEDIUM urgency. 
    The blocked person is getting frustrated. Please move it when possible! 🚗"
→ Delivery Status: SUCCESS_DIRECT
```

### **🔄 Smart Recovery (Expired Session)**
```
Scenario: User hasn't texted bot for 3 days

QR Scan (Rage 3) 
→ Session Check: EXPIRED 
→ Smart Template:
   "🚗 PARKING ALERT: Your vehicle ABC-123 needs attention.
    Quick actions: 👍 Moving now | ⏰ Need 5 minutes | ❓ More details"
→ User Clicks: "❓ More details" 
→ Session Reactivated 
→ AI Message:
   "Thanks for responding! Someone is blocked by your BMW ABC-123 with MEDIUM urgency..."
→ Delivery Status: SUCCESS_TEMPLATE_RECOVERY
```

### **🚨 Escalation Path (Non-Responsive User)**
```
Scenario: High rage, user doesn't respond to smart template

QR Scan (Rage 4) 
→ Session Check: EXPIRED 
→ Smart Template: Sent
→ Wait 5 minutes: NO RESPONSE
→ Rage-Specific Template:
   "🔥 CRITICAL: ABC-123 causing major disruption. Move NOW:
    👍 Moving immediately | ⏰ Need 2 minutes | 🆘 Emergency situation"
→ Wait 3 minutes: STILL NO RESPONSE (Rage = 5)
→ Emergency Template:
   "💀 EMERGENCY: ABC-123 blocking emergency access. MOVE IMMEDIATELY.
    This is your final notification. Further action may be taken."
→ Delivery Status: MAXIMUM_ESCALATION_REACHED
```

## 📊 Scaling Architecture

### **Session Health Management**
```javascript
// Automated Session Maintenance (Background Process)
Every 6 Hours:
  1. Check users with sessions expiring in next 18 hours
  2. Send subtle keep-alive messages to active users:
     - "Weekly parking update: 3 new spots near you 🅿️"
     - "Reminder: Your BMW sticker is active and working ✅"
  3. Track response rates and optimize timing

Session Analytics Dashboard:
  - Active Sessions: 1,247 users (73%)
  - Expiring Soon: 89 users (5%)
  - Template Recovery Rate: 67%
  - Escalation Prevention: 91%
```

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Cache Session Status**: Store in Redis for 1 hour
- **Batch Session Checks**: Update 100 users every 30 minutes
- **Rate Limit Templates**: Max 1 template per user per hour
- **Queue Management**: Prioritize by rage level (5 = immediate, 1 = 5min delay)
- **Template A/B Testing**: Optimize button text and success rates
