# ParkPatrol (Suggested Name - can be adjusted)

**Never get trapped by a parked car again!**

ParkPatrol is a smart QR sticker system designed to connect vehicle owners with those they might be inadvertently blocking. By placing a ParkPatrol QR sticker on their vehicle, owners can be instantly and privately notified via WhatsApp if their car is causing an obstruction, allowing for quick resolution.

## How It Works

1.  **Generate Sticker**: Vehicle owners create a personalized QR sticker through the ParkPatrol system. This sticker is then placed on their car (e.g., on the windscreen).
2.  **Scan & Notify**: If someone finds themselves blocked by a car with a ParkPatrol sticker, they simply scan the QR code with their smartphone.
3.  **Instant Notification**: The vehicle owner instantly receives a WhatsApp notification alerting them that their car is blocking someone. The notification includes the urgency level, determined by an AI-powered system.
4.  **Respond & Update**: The car owner can acknowledge the notification and provide an Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) directly through the system. The person waiting receives real-time updates.

## Key Features

*   **Instant WhatsApp Alerts**: Get notified in seconds when your vehicle is obstructing someone.
*   **AI-Powered Urgency**: Smart detection helps prioritize and manage notifications.
*   **Privacy Protected**: Your personal contact details are never exposed to the scanner. Communication is handled through the system.
*   **Mobile-First Design**: Easy to use on any smartphone for both scanning and responding.
*   **Driver Dashboard**: Manage your stickers, view notification history, and update your preferences.
*   **Sticker Generation**: Quickly create new QR stickers for your vehicles.
*   **(Admin Dashboard)**: For system oversight and management (if applicable).
